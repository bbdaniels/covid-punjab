# How to upload new data

## ICMR

Replace the `icmr.csv` file in this folder with the current _de-identified_ data.
Replace the `icmr_meta.csv` file in this folder with a version
that correctly reflects the updated metadata.

The _columns_ in the dataset, including the _order of the columns_,
must never change. The _rows_ may change or be added to.
